# Research project at TU Delft about the topic "Estimation of the probability of a union of rare events"

#### Research project conducted under the supervision of Dr. Joris Bierkens during my research internship at TU Delft for 4 months

Stochastic simulation of rare events in power systems. Estimation of rare event probabilities using Markov chain Monte Carlo and importance sampling methods  

- Study of a recent statistical algorithm presented in a research paper on the estimation of rare event probabilities using Markov chain Monte Carlo.
- Development of a method to expand the applicability of the algorithm and implementation of it in R.
- Nominated for the best ENSTA student research project.
